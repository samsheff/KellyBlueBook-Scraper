# KellyBlueBook-Scraper
A Scraper for Kelly Blue Book Car Prices.

# Usage
The scraper requires Nokogiri.
To use, simple clone the repo, run `bundle install` from the project directory and then `ruby main.rb`

# Notes
This is WIP in progress code that will most likely need to be modified to fit your use case. By default, it scrapes prices for most models from several major mamufacturers between the years 1992 and 2015 with milage between 10,000 and 135,000 at 5000 mile intervals.

If you beat me to cleaning this all up, feel free to contribute.
